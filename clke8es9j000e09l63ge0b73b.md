Dear Parents,

Don't tell your kids to get high grades. Instead, teach them to love to learn. Don't tell them to be the best in class. Instead, tell them to be the best they can be.

Don't tell them that grades are important. Instead, tell them that the lessons are important. It's what those lessons will teach them that will give them the skills to go through life.

Besides, if they love learning, their grades will follow and you'll get what you wanted in the first place without putting pressure on your children.

> I will continue...!
