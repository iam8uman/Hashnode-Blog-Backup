1. ### Slice in Redux, RTK ( One store - One Project )
    

Slice is the part of the store where individual task has been done. i.e eg in the case of todoSlice i do this.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1698475872442/7ddb7169-9f2a-49da-ac92-265b3f562f25.png align="center")

Mainly Slice has only 3 parts and they are  
`1. name 2. initialState 3. reducers`

Here 1. name refers to the sliceName and the initial state is like a constructor in OOP or we can say that it is the initial status of the slice. And finally, reducers are the functionality that what are the task that we are going to perform on that slice. In our case, we perform the tasks such as addTodo, deleteTodo, and updateTodo.

```javascript
// slice banau store vanne box lai...
// slice ma 3 ota kura hunxa 1. name 2. initialState 3. reducers
import {createSlice,nanoid} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
    todo:[{id:1,text:'hello word'}]
}

export const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name:'myTodos',
    initialState,
    reducers:{
        addTodo:(state,action)=>{
            const todo = {
                id:nanoid(),
                text:action.payload,
                completed:false
            }
            state.todo.push(todo)
        },
        removeTodo:(state,action)=>{
            const id = action.payload
            state.todo = state.todo.filter((todo)=>todo.id!==id)
        },
        updateTodo:(state,action)=>{
            const id = action.payload.id
            const text = action.payload.text
            state.todo.map((todo)=>{
                if(todo.id===id){
                    todo.text = text
                }
            })
        },
        deleteTodo:(state,action)=>{
            const id = action.payload.id
            state.todo = state.todo.filter((todo)=>todo.id!==id)
        }
    }

})
```

1. ## Typescript Defining Types & Interface.
    

Using the ***Interface*** we can define how the object should look like. For example, to create an object with an inferred type which includes `name: string` and `id: number`, you can write:

here we define an object like this

```javascript
const user = 
{  name: "Hayes",
  id: 0,
};
```

You can explicitly describe this <mark>object’s shape using an </mark> `interface` <mark>declaration: It define how the object should look like.</mark>

```javascript
interface User {
  name: string; 
 id: number;
};
```

You can then declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new `interface` by using syntax like `: TypeName` after a variable declaration:

```javascript
const user: User = { 
 name: "Hayes", 
 id: 0,
};
```

If you provide an object that doesn’t match the interface you have provided, TypeScript will warn you:

```javascript
interface User {
  name: string; 
 id: number;
};
 
const user: User = { 
 username: "Hayes",
 id: 0,
};
```

Here, Type '{ username: string; id: number; }' is not assignable to type 'User'. Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'username' does not exist in type 'User'.

1. ### Static type checking
    

What does it mean to static type check? Typescript provides a static type check you are saying but I am not understanding what you are trying to say.

**When we write code, we want it to work without any errors, because errors are like bugs in our code. Sometimes, when we make a mistake, we get an error, and it can be hard to figure out what went wrong.**

**To make things easier, we can use a tool like TypeScript. It's like a detective that looks at our code and figures out if there are any potential errors before we even run our program. It checks what our data should look like and how it should behave, and if it notices something doesn't match, it tells us, so we can fix it before our code breaks. This way, we can catch and fix mistakes early, making our code more reliable.**

```javascript
const message = "hello!";
 
message();
This expression is not callable.
  Type 'String' has no call signatures.
```
