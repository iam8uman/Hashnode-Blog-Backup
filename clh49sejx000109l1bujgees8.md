True Behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of Motivation, but the only reason you'll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.

Anyone can convenience themselves to visit the gym and eat healthy once or twice, but if you don't shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes.

Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are:

* The goal is not to READ a Book, The goal is to become a READER.
    
* The goal is not to write a Program, The goal is to become a PROGRAMMER.
    
* The goal is not to learn an instrument, The goal is to become a MUSICIAN.
    

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are either consciously or non-consciously.

Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
