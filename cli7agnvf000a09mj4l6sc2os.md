Dear UPI,

  
I hope you're doing well. I wanted to share my feelings with you. Writing this, my heart is full of affection. My heart is overflowing with affection, finding comfort in the way you make me feel, even when we're apart.

## How I Found You?

From the moment I saw you on TikTok, something shifted within me. Your simplicity, cuteness, and that adorable smile of yours completely captured my heart.

One single photo with the background song "**Jiu Dhanai Bhakeni**". I forget everything about that moment why am I here for?Tmlai(Whoever reading this) kehi nalagna sakxa But i still remember Unko nidhar ma vako sano kalo tika kati suhayeko. Ek aakha dhakine gari rakheko kapal ani fikka fikka nai kina nahos manda muskan. **Tha xaina maile k dekhe but jaba maile Unlai dekhe baki kehi dekhina.**

I've never felt this way before. You're different from anyone I've ever known. You have this amazing ability to make me feel happy even from a distance. Your smile is like sunshine, brightening up my darkest days.

Getting to know you through our messages has been an incredible experience. Not only are you beautiful on the outside, but your kindness and compassion shine through in everything you do.

## Mini Heart Attack...

I understand that you have a boyfriend, and I deeply respect your happiness. I don't want to disrupt what you have, but I wanted to let you know how deeply you've touched my heart. The connection may be one-sided but it is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and I'm willing to dedicate my life to you, without any conditions.

## Expectation

I may not be the most important person in your life

but I just hope that one day, when you hear my name you would just smile and say I miss this person. Hehe!

## Why do I like You?

I don't have an answer for that, but I guess it's just the vibes you give me, the smiles you put on my face, the laughs I get from talking to you, and just the fact that you can make me think of you even if we aren't talking at that moment. I honestly can't say there's an answer to that, but I will say that you are the reason I am happy every day.

I already confessed the main reason why I like you in the message box. Still, you can scroll this:)

## WHY ME...?\*

I may not have been the first person in your life, but I want to be the last person you ever loved and the only one who makes you feel loved to the core. From the depths of my heart, I want to be the one who brings you happiness and makes you feel cherished every single day.

I can't promise a perfect life, but I can promise you my unwavering love and support. You've awakened something in me that I never knew existed, and I can't imagine my future without you.

If, by some chance, we end up closer to each other, it would be a dream come true. But even if we remain apart, please know that I will always cherish the moments we've shared. You've had a profound impact on my life, and I'm grateful for every second spent getting to know you.

Thank you for being my inspiration and for making me believe in love.

Yours with all my heart,

Sumannnnnnnnnn.......
