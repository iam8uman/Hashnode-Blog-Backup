What I want to share is You need only **20 hours** of **focus** to be good at some things. It may be anything, any language, skills, or something. That you want to really do it.

The Famous book that I read earlier "**The Outliners**" tells us that we need **10,000 hours** of practice to be good enough at any skill. But the fact is that that amount of time is for to be **expert-level skills**.

If you really look at the **Learning curve**, it is not the perfect straight line. More importantly, If you try to learn something (let's say React.js):

* First, **2 hours** of learning is quite impressive and exciting too.
    
* After 2 hours of investment in that skills, you find you are not interested as much as you are earlier. And you slowly divert the path somewhere else. That's the point (**Markdown it**). Somehow you cross that **5 hours** after the first 2 hours. Then you will see some results right there.
    
* If you feel down at some point in the learning process, Remember "**WHY DID YOU START FIRST**"
    
* No matter what happens after that, you will continuously move forward. Coz you know the answer of **WHY, HOW & WHEN**.
    
* You can **divide 20 hours into 45min each day** for a month even with the break day in the middle.
    

### 1\. Deconstruct the skill: -

Decide exactly what you want to be able to do when you're done, and then look into the skill and break it down into smaller pieces.

### 2\. Learn enough to self**\-**correct: -

Learn just enough that you can actually practice and self-correct or self-edit as you practice.

### 3\. Remove barriers to practice: -

Remove the distractions that are keeping you from practicing.

### 4\. Practice for at least 20 hours: -

By pre-committing to practicing whatever it is that you want to do for at least 20 hours, you will be able to overcome the initial frustration barrier and stick with the practice long enough to actually reap the rewards.

### 5\. The major barrier's not intellectual, it's emotional.
