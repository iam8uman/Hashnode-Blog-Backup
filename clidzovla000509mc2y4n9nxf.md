The statement that "motivation is overrated; environment often matters more" suggests that while motivation is important, the surrounding environment or context in which a person operates can have a more significant impact on their behavior and outcomes. Let's delve into this idea further.

1. **Influence of the Environment:**
    
    Our environment encompasses various factors such as physical surroundings, social interactions, cultural norms, and available resources. These elements significantly shape our behaviors and decisions. For instance, consider a person who aspires to become an artist. If they live in a community that lacks artistic opportunities, resources, and supportive networks, it becomes much harder for them to pursue their passion and develop their skills. Conversely, if the same person resides in a vibrant artistic community with abundant resources and supportive mentors, their chances of success and motivation to pursue their art increase significantly.
    
2. **Role of External Factors:**
    
    External factors often play a crucial role in determining our motivation levels. For example, if a person is surrounded by positive and supportive individuals who believe in their abilities, it can enhance their motivation to strive for success. Conversely, a negative or unsupportive environment can hinder motivation and create self-doubt. Similarly, external rewards and incentives, such as recognition, praise, or financial benefits, can greatly influence an individual's motivation to perform a certain task or achieve a goal.
    
3. **Impact of Routine and Habits:**
    
    Our environment plays a significant role in shaping our routines and habits, which, in turn, affect our motivation levels. For instance, if someone lives in an environment that encourages healthy habits like regular exercise and balanced nutrition, they are more likely to stay motivated and maintain a healthy lifestyle. On the other hand, an environment that lacks healthy options and promotes sedentary behaviors can dampen one's motivation to prioritize physical well-being.
    
4. **Availability of Resources:**  
    The availability of resources, such as education, opportunities, and support systems, can have a profound impact on motivation. If a person has access to quality education, mentorship, and relevant resources in their environment, they are more likely to feel motivated and empowered to pursue their goals. Conversely, a lack of resources or limited opportunities can hinder motivation and create a sense of frustration or hopelessness.
    

While motivation is important as it drives us to take action and pursue our goals, it can be heavily influenced by the environment. A supportive and conducive environment can fuel and sustain motivation, while a challenging or unsupportive environment can hinder it. Recognizing the interplay between motivation and the surrounding context is crucial for understanding human behavior and fostering personal growth and development.

It's worth noting that the degree to which environment or motivation impacts an individual can vary depending on the person and the specific situation. Both factors are interconnected and can influence each other in a complex manner.

### What Atomic Habit actually says about it?

It starts with an example it says "Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the "choice architecture" of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary refrigerators, but the water was not available at all drink locations.

Over the next 3 months, the number of soda sales at the hospital dropped by 11.4%. Meanwhile, sales of water bottles increased by 25.8%. They made similar adjustments and saw similar results with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to anyone eating there.

<details data-node-type="hn-details-summary"><summary>What did I learn from this Example?</summary><div data-type="detailsContent">Yes, of course, Motivation is also a greater factor to build and continue your habit. But if you could make your environment habit friendly then it stands longer than you expected. In the above example, nobody motivates to drink water in this cafeteria rather just a simple change in the environment provides us the greater result.</div></details>
