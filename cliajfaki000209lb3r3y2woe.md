Dear **UPI**,

Sooner, we go back to being strangers, it's okay. That doesn't mean I hate you, or I forget about you. It just simply means that I am giving you back your peace. I want you to live your life the way you deserve it. Meeting you and falling in love with you wasn't a mistake. It was the most precious gift I have ever received from god's side.

As I write this goodbye message, my heart feels heavy with different feelings. This is the toughest task I would never want to do. You know how badly I want you. Coming from a middle-class family, I always focused on my career above everything else. But when I saw you, everything shifted.

Even though we only communicated through messages, it brought me so much joy and a special connection that I had never experienced before. Your simplicity, cuteness, and that beautiful smile of yours had a magical effect on me. It felt like you completed a part of me, filling my life with love and happiness.

But life has its own plans, and sometimes it presents unexpected challenges. I understand and respect the fact that you have a boyfriend. Your happiness and well-being are important, and I would never want to disrupt that.

So, with a heavy heart, I have to say goodbye. The time we spent together, even through messages, meant the world to me. You ignited something within me and made me realize that there is more to life than just chasing career goals.

You know one thing, At some point in time "I just wish I met you earlier in this life. Then I realize She is Beautiful and had many options why would she even choose me?"

`But for now, Don't worry about me.`

`Focus on your studies,`  
`I will support you from behind,`  
`You will be always my favorite person,`  
`Only you,`  
`Always take care!`
