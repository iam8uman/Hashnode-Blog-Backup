At the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In relationships, it's called dating. In college, it's called the liberal arts. In business, it's called split testing.

**What does all of this stuff say?**  
ANS: Try everything, explore whatever comes around you. Only then you can find or decide where to. Also about your future too "What to do in the future"

The goal is to try out many possibilities, research abroad range of ideas and cast a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you've found --- but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you're winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.

### <mark>REMEMBER 2 Things:</mark>

### What feels like fun to me, but work to others?

* The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people.
    
* When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you are made to do.

### What comes naturally to me?

* For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you.
    
* Look inside yourself and ask,  
    "What feels natural to me?"  
    "When have I felt alive?"  
    "When have I felt like the real me?"
    
* No internal judgments or people pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just a feeling of engagement and enjoyment.
    
* **<mark>Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, You are headed in the right direction.</mark>**
