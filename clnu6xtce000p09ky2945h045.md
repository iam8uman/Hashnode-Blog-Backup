When you use `React.createContext()` a React application doesn't create a global variable in the traditional JavaScript sense. Instead, it creates a special object called a **<mark>"context object"</mark>** that can be used to pass data through the component tree without the need to explicitly pass props down through every level of the tree.

### \--&gt;context object, you can define in the App.js,

In our case of the below example, context objects are these functions. We mention them only. in createContext we just mention them. But not explain.  
`addTodo`  
`updateTodo   deleteTodo   toggleTodo`

```javascript
const TodoContext = React.createContext({
    todos:[
        {
            id:1,
            todo:"Message of TODO",
            completed:false
        }
    ],
    addTodo:(todo)=>{},
    updateTodo:(id,todo)=>{},
    deleteTodo:(id)=>{},
    toggleComplete:(id)=>{}
});
```

Or In simple words,

```javascript
const FirstNameContext=React.createContext(
{
FirstName:"Suman Sharma"
},
)
```

1. ### Importance of <mark>index.js</mark> file in every directory
    

When you have an index.js file in every directory. For eg. If you have a Navbar directory and inside this index.js file

When you try to use that index.js file by importing it. You can just give the path up to the directory.

```javascript
import {Display} from './component/Nabar'
// if inside component and inside Navbar there is index.js file
```

1. ### State update on the previous value.
    

```javascript
setData((prev)=>(prev+1))
```

I am using in todoContextAPI Day23

```javascript
  const addTodo=(todooo)=>{
      setTodos((prev)=>[{id:Date.now(),...todooo},...prev])
  }
```

1. ### Filter ( ) in js
    
    The `filter` method in JavaScript is like a filter for your list of items. It helps you pick out items from a list that meet certain rules and put them in a new list. The original list stays the same.
    
    \* Matlab filter () le array items lai filter garera naya array provide garxa. Simple  
    Syntax  
    

```javascript
const newArray = originalArray.filter(callback(element, index, array), thisArg);
```

Eg. of filter method

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];

// Filter out even numbers
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((number)=> {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### I used it in todoContextAPI like this

```javascript
 const deleteTodo=(idd)=>{
        setTodos((prev)=>prev.filter((todo)=>todo.id!==idd))
  }
```

here what happens, when you want to delete some items. then you sent id of that item. In this code, idd get that id, and this `setTodos((prev)=>prev.filter((todo)=>todo.id!==idd)`

it filter those todos which id's does not match to the delete id and return the array of that items.
