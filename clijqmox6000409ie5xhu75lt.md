Are you interested in acquiring Python programming skills like me? Perhaps you're contemplating a career in IT and want to explore your options. In this article, I will address fundamental inquiries regarding Python learning approaches and available resources.

Python stands as one of the most widely used programming languages in today's technological landscape, finding applications in various industries. Prior to delving into our exploration of the finest learning resources for Python, let us first grasp the concept of programming.

## First Of All, <mark>Why Computer Programming</mark>?

In the most basic terms, programming means automating a task. It could be as simple as sending an email or organizing files on your computer. It could also be as complicated as collecting data from different sources, cleaning and processing it, using it to train a machine learning model, and then making predictions based on that data. Thus, whatever the task, the goal of programming is to make your life easier by automating stuff.

At the same time, programming lets us take advantage of the great processing power and vast memories of computers. Without the computational capabilities of computers, training a machine learning model with gigabytes of data would be an insurmountable task.

Programming languages are what we use to give instructions to a computer. There are lots of programming languages. Each one has a different syntax or way of writing these instructions to the computer. It is important for a programming language to have a syntax that is easy for humans to read and understand. (It would be very challenging to give instructions in a language you don’t understand!) Because its syntax is quite simple, Python is considered one of the best programming languages for beginners to learn.

## **<mark>Why Python?</mark>**

Python's power is not diminished by its simple syntax, and this is evident in its adoption by numerous tech giants:

* Google recognizes Python as an official language.
    
* Python plays a significant role in the development of YouTube.
    
* Major companies such as Netflix, IBM, NASA, Pixar, Facebook, and Spotify rely on Python for their operations.
    
* Python is also utilized by Pinterest and Instagram.
    

Python's accomplishments align with the aspirations of its creator, Guido van Rossum, who introduced the language in 1991. He aimed to develop a language that:

* Possesses the same level of power as its main competitors while maintaining simplicity and intuitiveness.
    
* Embraces an open-source philosophy, allowing contributions from anyone.
    
* Features code that is as comprehensible as plain English.
    
* Is suitable for everyday tasks.
    
* Facilitates quick development cycles.

## How to start learning Python?

1. ## Youtube

    YouTube is the largest online video platform. Not surprisingly, it contains a massive amount of Python content. You can find one-off videos explaining a particular concept as well as playlists consisting of several videos on more general subjects.
    
    If you are looking for more structured and organized content, I suggest following proven Python learning channels. [**TECHTFQ**](https://www.youtube.com/c/techTFQ) is a great one that contains several videos on Python. [**PROGRAMMING WITH MOSH**](https://www.youtube.com/c/programmingwithmosh/featured) is another channel that has many Python tutorials.
    
2. ## Books

    For those who prefer to learn Python by reading about it, there are many books available. [**AUTOMATE THE BORING STUFF WITH PYTHON**](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a highly popular one and it is free to read online. Another popular book for learning Python is [**PYTHON CRASH COURSE**](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e) by Eric Matthes. You will learn basic programming concepts and have the chance to go through the projects covered in the book.
    
    If you are into Python for data science, [**PYTHON FOR DATA SCIENCE FOR DUMMIES**](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Python+for+Data+Science+For+Dummies,+2nd+Edition-p-9781119547662) would be a great start. It’s an introductory-level book that will help you get started with your Python data science journey. You can see more of our picks for the [**BEST PYTHON DATA SCIENCE BOOKS HERE**](https://learnpython.com/blog/best-python-books-for-data-science/).
    
3. ## **Official Python Documentation**
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686022983005/730a5c46-9c84-4439-b6f5-69ffc8111681.jpeg align="center")
    
    Thanks to its active open-source community, Python has extensive [**DOCUMENTATION**](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). The official documentation usually has the most up-to-date features and covers a substantial amount of detail. It might be a little bit more difficult to read, but the information covered in the documentation is definitely worth your time.
    
    You do not have to read all of the documentation. In fact, that’s not an efficient way to learn Python programming. However, you should use it freely as a reference and get familiar with it so you can easily find what you are looking for.
    
4. ## **Learn Python: The Complete Python Programming Course**
    
    [**THIS UDEMY VIDEO COURSE**](https://www.udemy.com/course/pythonforbeginners/)
    
    ![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686023024690/ca9c9ea4-48ef-4b0c-9d6a-74c4fa33ce38.jpeg align="center")
    
    covers a wide range of Python topics, from the very basics to advanced concepts. Video courses are good for those who prefer learning by watching, but be sure to support them with hands-on coding experience. Once you watch your video, practice what you learn by writing code and solving exercises. (The same goes for learning by reading books or documentation – be sure to practice!)
