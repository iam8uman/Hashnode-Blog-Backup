## "Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?"

This is the central question you must ask every time to ensure that you are doing right or wrong. The first step is not **WHAT** or **HOW** but **WHO**. You need to know who you want to be.

Have you asked yourself, "WHY it is so easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? " It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation.

The answer to the above question is that bad habit has a greater impact on your life. Let's take an example If you smoke regularly, and then you asked the same question yourself "**Why you couldn't quit this habit?**". The most suitable answer from your side might be "**The feeling of relief it provides**". At such a stage, you are a true smoker. Your identity is a smoker. Here now I introduced IDENTITY. Every habit is associated with an individual identity.

### The Two-Step Process To Changing Your Identity.

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.

The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have to proof of it. If you study for one hour every night, you have evidence that you are studious.

Of course, your habits are not the only action that influences your identity, but by virtue of their frequency, they are usually the most important ones.

Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That's the paradox of making small improvements. This results:

* Each time you write a page, you are a writer.
    
* Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.
    
* Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.
    

### And I told you habits are part of your identity, then how to make good habits through **good IDENTITY**.

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
    
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
    

First, decide who you want to be. This is the big question and many people aren't sure where to begin but they do know what kind of results they want: If you are sure about what type of person you want to be, then you have to prove it with small wins for example if you want to be a good reader then you have to prove it every day that you spend at least 10 min each day by reading books. That's it.

## THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER.

You have the power to change your belief about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today.

Why am I saying this, You might say I don't need such type of motivation at all. You might be right but not here, Why I will tell you? wait...

Building better habits isn't about littering your day with life hacks. It's not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It's not about achieving external measures of success like earning more money, losing weight, or reducing stress. Habits can help you achieve all of these things, but fundamentally they are not about having something. They are about becoming someone.

Ultimately, your habits matter because they help you become the type of person you wish to be. They are the channel through which you develop your deepest beliefs about yourself. Quite literally, you become your habits.
