1. ### what is strandbeest robot? Do you know about it. Please let me know.
    

ANS:

The Strandbeest (Dutch for "beach animal") is a unique type of kinetic sculpture created by Dutch artist Theo Jansen.

It is designed to mimic the walking movements of animals using wind power.

While the Strandbeest itself is not a robot in the traditional sense, it exhibits robotic-like behavior through its intricate mechanisms.

The Strandbeest consists of PVC pipes, joints, and various mechanical components that enable it to move by harnessing wind energy. Its <mark>complex leg mechanisms allow it to walk on sandy beaches by responding to the direction and force of the wind</mark>. As the wind catches the sails on the Strandbeest, it transfers the energy to a system of levers and gears, generating the leg movements that propel it forward.

Theo Jansen's Strandbeests have gained international recognition for their intricate design and artistic appeal. They showcase a fusion of engineering, biology, and aesthetics, which has inspired many people, including educators, to explore their potential as educational tools.

Adapting the concept of the Strandbeest into a robot for educational purposes might involve incorporating additional electronic components, sensors, and control systems to enhance its functionality. This modification could allow students to explore concepts like robotics, programming, and automation while still drawing inspiration from Theo Jansen's original design.

By building and interacting with a Strandbeest-inspired robot, students can gain hands-on experience with mechanical engineering, kinematics, and programming. It provides an engaging way to explore STEM principles, fostering creativity, problem-solving skills, and a deeper understanding of engineering and robotics concepts.

It's worth noting that there are variations of the Strandbeest design, and different individuals or organizations may create their own interpretations or adaptations of the concept. The specifics of a Strandbeest robot can vary depending on the design choices and goals of the project.

### More About It....

1. <mark>Evolution and Design</mark>: Theo Jansen has been developing Strandbeests since the early 1990s. Over the years, he has refined the design through a series of iterations, introducing new mechanisms and improving their walking capabilities. The goal is to create self-propelling, autonomous creatures that can survive and roam on beaches.
    
2. <mark>Walking Mechanism</mark>: The walking mechanism of a Strandbeest is based on a system of crankshafts, levers, and connecting rods. These components work together to convert the rotational motion generated by wind energy into a walking motion. Each leg of the Strandbeest has multiple sections and joints, allowing it to mimic the movements of animal limbs.
    
3. <mark>Energy Storage</mark>: To ensure continuous movement, some versions of the Strandbeest feature an energy storage mechanism. This can involve the use of plastic bottles connected to the legs, which gradually fill with air when the wind is strong. The stored air pressure can then be released to power the movement during periods of low wind.
    
4. <mark>Wind Sensing</mark>: Some Strandbeest designs incorporate rudimentary wind sensors that help the sculptures align themselves with the wind direction. These sensors may consist of simple vane mechanisms or more advanced systems using electronic sensors.
    
5. <mark>Artistic Expression</mark>: While the primary focus of the Strandbeest is on engineering and mechanics, they are also regarded as works of art. The graceful and organic movements and their unusual appearance have captivated audiences worldwide. Jansen's sculptures often blur the line between art and engineering, inspiring creativity and imagination.
    
6. <mark>Educational Potential</mark>: The Strandbeest concept has been embraced in educational settings as a tool for teaching various STEM subjects. By building simplified versions or adaptations of the Strandbeest, students can learn about mechanics, kinematics, and aerodynamics, and even delve into more advanced topics like control systems and automation.
    

It's worth noting that there are different variations and interpretations of the Strandbeest concept, and the level of complexity can vary. Some projects aim for faithful recreations of Jansen's designs, while others explore new possibilities by incorporating modern technologies like microcontrollers and sensors.

### StrandBeest Robot

* According to Theo Janson, "He describes them as ‘skeletons that walk on the wind, so they don’t have to eat’. He compares their creation to an evolution of ‘**new forms of life**, and plans to leave them to ‘live their own lives in herds on beaches"
    
* Strandbeest refers to "Beach Animal"
    
* In the 1990s it is designed to mimic the walking movement of animals using wind power.
    
* Strandbeests are dramatically  
    **<mark>Mathematical</mark>** in concept, (that single triangle ko barema explain)  
    **<mark>Engineering</mark>** marvels in structure,  
    **<mark>technological</mark>** wonders in materials applications, and very **<mark>scientific</mark>** in their evolution  
    (the systematic accumulation of knowledge), thus the perfect STEM life form.
    
* Strandbeests are dramatically mathematical in concept, engineering marvels in structure, technological wonders in materials applications, and very scientific in their evolution (the systematic accumulation of knowledge), thus the perfect STEM life form.
    
* It's easy to walk on hard sand but not the same on soft sand. In the case of soft sand pressured air helps them to move.
    
* You might don't like the structure of that robot, But i would love to share what the creator said about it. “I don’t want to make ‘nice’ animals, I just want to make surviving animals,”
    
* "proportion of the lengths of the tubes which are in-between the spine and the shoe is 13(1/13)." that’s the special thing about Strandbeests because normal animals always toss up and down as they walk, but the Strandbeests stay on the same level.
    
* In school days lots of teachers talked about Kinetic energy, energy storage, and energy conversion but no one could tell how it works. Strandbeest is the perfect example of  
    <mark>Wind energy<br>Energy storage</mark>  
    <mark>Energy conversion (wind-kinetic)<br>Movement through that store energy.</mark>
    
* Lots of teacher of talks about the angle, and its type but nobody talks about where it actually be used. With the help of this strandbeest we can teach school students the usefulness of angles(math) with a practical product.
