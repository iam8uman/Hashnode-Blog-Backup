One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing.

### How does Habit Scorecard work?

### First, we make a list of your daily habits.

* Wake up
    
* Turn Off Alarm
    
* Check my phone
    
* Go to the bathroom
    
* Take shower
    
* Brush my teeth
    
* Hand up a towel to dry
    
* Physical exercise 5-10 min
    
* Meditation
    
* Read at least 10 page
    
* Check my phone before going to college
    
* .......... and so on.
    

Once you have a complete list, look at each behavior and ask yourself, "Is this a good, bad, or neutral habit?". If it is a good habit, write "+" next to it. If it is a bad habit, write "-". If it a neutral habit, write "=".

## Just like that.

* Wake up =
    
* Turn Off Alarm =
    
* Check my phone -
    
* Go to the bathroom =
    
* Take shower =
    
* Brush my teeth =
    
* Hand up a towel to dry =
    
* Physical exercise 5-10 min +
    
* Meditation +
    
* Read at least 10 pages +
    
* Check my phone before going to college -
    

As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.

Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. **Don't blame yourself for your faults. Don't praise yourself for your successes.**

**If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as if you were watching someone else**. **Oh, How interesting that they would do such a thing.**

Once you make your complete Habit Scorecard, the First step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-and-Calling in your own life.

If you want to leave a bad habit in your habit scorecard, say out loud, "I'm using my mobile phone extremely, so I don't need to check my phone every time rather I only check my phone once in a certain time"
