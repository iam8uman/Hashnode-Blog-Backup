## What I learned today from this topic is as written below:

* 1\. State=condition of any component for eg. textarea component might be empty sometime , sometimes it has letters .
    
* 2\. Hooks= A method which helps us to use features of classes in function based component this is because developer like us prefer to use function over classes.
    
* 3\. Hooks has this part ----&gt; const \[count,setCount)=useState("Hello Universe"); Here in above hook the value of count is Hello Universe. the count is an array variable so that we just can't update or change its value like a normal variable. But we can update or change its value using the setCount() method. i.e. setCount("Hey You"); this implies the value of count is updated to Hey You.
    

### What is inside this mini-project and what did i do?

\---&gt; Project provides mini textarea and 2/3 buttons like UpperCase, LowerCase, and No. of letters. we change the text value according to the buttons instruction using state and event. Its more simple as we use onClick={ClickFunction) and we define its functionality as well.

\* Note: Advantages of hooks and this stuff, whenever you click the Uppercase button page does not reload. Which enhances its capability. IMP\*

When i clicked to UpperCase button then it changes like this:

### In this way this mini-project is successful. And i also learn some other topics too.

1. State Hooks
